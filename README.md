# nn_photo_improvement
This is the repository for a project of improving photos using neural network

In this project I will try to research techniques to enhance photos. By enhance I mean anything that will make a photo more beautiful, which can be useful for publishing on social media. Eventually this should be a smartphone app.
First thing I will try is autoencoders with original image as an input and enhanced image as an output.
